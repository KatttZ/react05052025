#  Async, Promises & The Event Loop

## üîÅ Event Loop
The **event loop** continuously checks the **event queue**.  
If the **call stack** is empty and the queue has pending tasks, it pushes them onto the stack to execute their callbacks.

---

##  Execution Model

###  1. Thread & Call Stack

- JavaScript is **single-threaded** ‚Äî executes one command at a time.
- A thread includes:
  -  **Memory**: stores variables
  -  **Call Stack**: tracks function calls (LIFO structure)

#### Call Stack

- Functions are pushed when called and popped when completed.
- The **Global Execution Context** is always at the bottom.

####  Synchronous Code

- Executes line-by-line, waiting for each line to finish.
- **Blocking** means code execution is stuck waiting on something.

---

###  2. Web APIs (Browser Environment)

**Web APIs** are browser-provided features that handle asynchronous tasks, such as:

- `setTimeout`, `setInterval`
- `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`
- DOM Manipulation
- `localStorage` / `sessionStorage`
- Geolocation API


These APIs offload async tasks and push callbacks to the **event queue** when complete.

---

###  3. Execution Context

Each context includes:

- **Creation Phase**: Memory allocation for variables and functions
- **Execution Phase**: Code is executed line by line

Types of Execution Contexts:
- üåç Global Execution Context (created at program start)
- üß© Function Execution Context (created on each function call)

---

##  Callback Hell

**Callback Hell** happens when too many nested callbacks make code hard to read:

```js
firstFunction(args, function () {
  secondFunction(args, function () {
    thirdFunction(args, function () {
      // And so on‚Ä¶
    });
  });
});
```

Four easy ways to manage callback hell:

1. Write comments
2. Split functions into smaller functions
3. Using Promises
4. Using Async/await

## Promise
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

```js
const promise1 = newPromise((resolve, reject) => {
  // async logic here
})
```

**Promise States**
- pending: initial state
- fulfilled: completed successfully
- rejected: failed with an error



**Promise Concurrency Methods**:
These static methods help manages multiple Promises
takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise


| Method                 | Behavior                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Promise.all()`        | Resolves when **all** promises fulfill; rejects if **any** reject |
| `Promise.allSettled()` | Resolves when **all** settle (fulfilled or rejected)              |
| `Promise.any()`        | Resolves when **any** promise fulfills; rejects if **all** reject |
| `Promise.race()`       | Resolves/rejects as soon as the **first** promise settles         |


‚úÖ Use Promise.all() for tasks that must all succeed.
‚úÖ Use Promise.any() when you're happy with the first successful result.
‚úÖ Use Promise.allSettled() to get results of all promises regardless of failure.
‚ö†Ô∏è Use Promise.race() with caution ‚Äî the first one wins, even if it's an error.


## Async / Await
An async function always returns a Promise;
await pauses execution until the Promise settles.

```js
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(url);
    const data = await res.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}
```
