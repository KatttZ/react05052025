//create a function that returns the average
//package price

//Create a function that returns an object where
//the keys are the different package names and
//the values are an array of the show titles
//available with that package

//Create a function that takes in a show title
//and returns the name of the cheapest package
//that show can be watched with

//create a function that takes in two parameters,
//a package name and a rating(number between 0 and 10),
//and returns all shows available with that package,
//with that rating or higher

//given an array and a chunk size, divide the
//array into many sub-arrays where each sub-array
//has the specified length. E.g
//chunkArray([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],5)
//should return [[1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13]]
